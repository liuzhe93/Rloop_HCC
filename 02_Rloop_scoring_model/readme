A key component of this study is the R-loop scoring model, calculated using the cal_CRDscore function.
This model integrates the expression levels of known R-loop regulators to infer the R-loop state.
The scoring algorithm was independently applied to both single-cell and bulk RNA-sequencing datasets.
Based on the resulting scores, patient samples were classified into high-score and low-score subgroups for downstream analysis.
